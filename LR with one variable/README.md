## Linear regression with one variable
I went to [quinnliu's machine learning repository](https://github.com/Babababanana/machineLearning/tree/master/supervisedLearning/linearRegressionIn1Variable) for reference. And I also used the data provided in it.

### Steps
1. Get training set X and Y
2. Set initial theta_0, theta_1 and learning rate alpha
3. Gradient descent, least square error is used to compute cost
4. Get final thetas which is the coefficients of the final model
5. Visualization

### Results
theta_0 = 3.6302914394043597

theta_1 = 1.166362350335582
